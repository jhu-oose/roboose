# GitHub Infrastructure

## Repositories

**Staff (\<course\>-staff, for example, [2019-staff](https://github.com/jhu-oose/2019-staff)):** Staff forum and grading.

**Students (\<course\>-students, for example, [2019-students](https://github.com/jhu-oose/2019-students))**: Public forum and videos of lectures.

**Individual Student (\<course\>-student-\<identifier\>, for example, [2019-student-jhu-oose-fake-student](https://github.com/jhu-oose/2019-student-jhu-oose-fake-student)):** Private forum, assignment submission, and grade delivery.

**Group (\<course\>-group-\<identifier\>, for example, [2019-group-fake-group](https://github.com/jhu-oose/2019-group-fake-group)):** Group project.

## Teams

Repositories that aren’t Individual Students’s repositories have a [team](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-teams) associated with them, for example, [2019-staff](https://github.com/orgs/jhu-oose/teams/2019-staff). These teams are necessary for the following reasons:

**Access Management:** For example, teams make it easier to add staff to all Individual Students’s repositories.

**Team Notifications:** For example, `@jhu-oose/2019-staff`. [Roboose](https://github.com/jhu-oose/roboose) adds team notifications like these automatically when relevant.
